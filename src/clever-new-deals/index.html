  <h1>new deal listeners</h1>
  <p>
    One of my favorite traditions at Clever is seeing how the new deal listeners have grown and developed over time.
    What started as a nice way to celebrate new business has continued and improved over the years.
    That said, as time has gone on sometimes listeners are lost or forgotten.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site is meant as a archive of this bit of culture.

    (This list is sorted in roughly chronological order. If I'm forgetting any listeners please 
    <a href="https://cozmo.io">get in touch</a>)
  </sub>

  <h2>the original</h2>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/mattpasternack?lang" target="_blank class="user-link">@mp</a>'s <span class="listener">new deal</span> - the image that started it all.
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/new-deal.png" />
  Also at some point as a joke this transitioned into <i>enter the new deal</i>.
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/enter-the-new-deal.png" />

  <h2>dealfather</h2>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-laufer/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@will</a>'s <span class="listener">dealfather</span> i suppose was the beginning of the traditiion..and it's still one of the better listeners
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/dealfather.png" />

  <h2>aaron</h2>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronsokol/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@sokol</a> never had an offical listener ðŸ™ƒ but for some reason we have this picture of him instead. He would alternate between swearing it off and somehow finding a reason to drop it into hipchat.
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/unnamed-aaron-nip-pick.png" />

  We also had this one off listener for closing Miami Dade.
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/clever-miami-vice.png" />

  <h2>prince of process</h2>
  around this time we started making listeners for account managers, although we never really figured out when to use them. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bsgordon/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@brandon</a>'s <span class="listener">prince of process</span> wasn't even about accounts. 
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/prince-of-process.png" />

  <h2>deal of the century</h2>
  similarily i can't remember the origin behind <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eleanor-dorfman-94615520/" class="user-link">@eld</a>'s <span class="listener">deal of the century</span>, besides a love of history.
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/deal-of-the-century.png" />

  <h2>deal with it</h2>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katy-elkin/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@katy</a>'s non-animated <span class="listener">deal with it</span>
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/deal-with-it.jpg" />

  <h2>josie</h2>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephinepang/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@josie</a> had <span class="listener">crocodile dundeal</span> which remained some of the better wordplay for years to&nbsp;come.
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/crocodile-dun-deal.png" />

  <h2>boombrothers</h2>
  The one the only
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/boom-brothers.png" />

  <h2>anything passes as a listener these days</h2>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tpfrench/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@tim</a> magazine/<span class="listener">deal of the year</span>, the only listener that caused <a href="https://twitter.com/rfgarcia" class="user-link" target="_blank">@raf</a> to say "anything passes as a listener these days".
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/tim-magazine.png" />

  <h2>the big fella</h2>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-reed-3b1b6422/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@dave</a> is <span class="listener">the real deal</span>
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/real-deal.png" />

  <h2>cyrus</h2>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyruslalkaka/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@cyrus</a> had <span class="listener">dem dealz</span>
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/dem-dealz.png" />
  but sometimes he was truly a <span class="listener">dealsmith</span>
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/dealsmith.gif" />

  <h2>dave</h2>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davemgilbert/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@dgilbert</a>'s <span class="listener">fresh hot deals</span> remains one of my favorite listeners to this day
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/fresh-hot-deals.png" />

  <h2>whitman</h2>
  originally this was supposed to be <span class="listener">whit great power comes great deals</span> but <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenneth-d-whitfield-jr-1b103b1b/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@whit</a>'s refusal to say the trigger caused the true listener to be <span class="listener">New application partner:</span>
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/whitman.png" />

  <h2>mcr -> ice -> matthew cometh</h2>

  <h2>dinasaurus</h2>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dinalawrence/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@dina</a> had the hand crafted <span class="listener">dinasaurus deal</span>
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/dina.png" />

  <h2>ready to deal</h2>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikaylawk/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@mikayla</a>'s listener was triggered by <span class="listener">to the crew</span>, meant to be triggered by <span class="listener">welcome [APP] to the crew</span>
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/ready-to-deal.png" />

  <h2>mack attack</h2>
  the origin of <span class="listener">mack attack</span> was lost to the sands of time, but listener had sticking power.
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/mack-attack.jpg" />

  <h2>jennasis</h2>
  <span class="listener">jennasis</span> for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenna-james-3b086533/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@jenna</a> was the first (and currently only) listener for SIS partnerships. also the first and only listener that had to be cropped to remain SFW
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/jennasis.png" />
  
  <h2>the enterprise strikes back</h2>
  <span class="listener">the enterprise strikes back</span> - A deal listener we never got the chance to use ðŸ˜ž
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/enterprise-strikes-back.png" />

  <h2>hailey</h2>
  <span class="listener">upsell and recreation</span> - unclear the story behind this one, and a relatively offputting photoshop job as well.
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/upsell-and-recreation.png" />

  <h2>deadliest catch</h2>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-hartnett-sf/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@ryan</a> had <span class="listener">deadliest catch</span> - a lot going on in this listener
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/deadliest-catch.png" />

  <h2>goals</h2>
  <p>most of the goals team all had their own listeners</p>

  <span class="listener">black diamond deal</span> for <a href="https://twitter.com/mpkisow" class="user-link" target="_blank">@kisow</a> - one of my favorite details about this listener is the eleanor entry in race timer, since he was still behind her in goals revenue closed at this point.
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/black-diamond-deal.gif" />

  <span class="listener">bend it like brandon</span>, a study in low quality rotoscoping. 
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/bend-it-like-brandon.gif" />

  there was <span class="listener">on the house</span>, which is ironic since goals was the first district product <i>not on the house</i>.
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/on-the-house.png" />

  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonbubb" class="user-link" target="_blank">@bubb</a> had <span class="listener">doggon deal</span>
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/doggon-deal.png" />

  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markalsdorf/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@mark</a> loved those stroopwafels, so he got <span class="listener">stroopwafel deal</span>
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/stroopwafel-deal.png" />

  <h2>paul</h2>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulnpham/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@paul</a> was closing large upsell before it was even part of his job, and that story is told via <span class="listener">the paul signal</span>, as in <i>light</i> <span class="listener">the paul signal</span>
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/lighting-the-paul-signal.gif" />

  <h2>amy</h2>
  we have <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asanka-dharma-17788237/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@asanka</a> to thank for <span class="listener">the amy factor</span>
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/the-amy-factor.gif" />

  <h2>darrell</h2>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrellastewart/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@darrell</a> had <span class="listener">catch it in the library</span>. the logos on the jersey are the team he played for.
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/catch-it-in-the-library.png" />

  <h2>fabio</h2>
  <span class="listener">rio de dinheiro</span> for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fmori/" class="user-link" target="_blank">@fabio</a> is one of my favorite listeners both visually but also due to the word play
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/rio-de-dinheiro.gif" />

  <h2>tiger keenan</h2>
  <span class="listener">tiger keenan</span> for <a href="http://keenanp.com" class="user-link" target="_blank">@keenan</a> was one of the first cross species listeners that passed muster 
  <img src="https://templaedhel.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-deal-listeners/tiger-keenan.png" />
